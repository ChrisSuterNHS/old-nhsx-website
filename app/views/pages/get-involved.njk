    <p>We are keen to hear from everyone who is affected by the technology we use in health and care, from patients to technologists and innovators to carers to clinicians.</p>
    
    <p>We are currently seeking views on an <a href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-information-and-tools/designing-and-building-products-and-services">NHS Digital Health Technology Standard</a> and our <a href="https://jointheconversation.scwcsu.nhs.uk/tech-plan">tech plan for health and care</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Engaging with digital health innovators</h2>

    <p>On 4 July 2019, NHSX held a listening event for innovators working in healthtech, in partnership with the Accelerated Access Collaborative, the Academic Health Science Network, the Office for Life Sciences and techUK. At the event, we asked the innovators what NHSX's priorities should be. This <a href="../assets/Digital_Innovation_in_Healthcare_Report_Web_Accessible.pdf">digital innovators summary report</a> details the key themes that emerged and how we are responding to them.</p>

    <p>We run monthly surgeries for digital innovators to meet with members of our Digital Innovation Team. These provide us with the opportunity to learn more about you and your product; and for you to ask us for advice on issues, such as scaling within the NHS. If you would like to register for a surgery, please fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpEZeF8x0aHEPrwHcPe0NBbVrddh27F5AK5zfsELsd3BDeVQ/viewform">innovator application form</a>.</p>
